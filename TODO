For 1.0
  o Support more platforms in entropy gathering
  o Cleanup function
  o Namespace the public functions.
  o Add an addrandom function
  o Make it able to call itself arc4random
  . Win32
    o Omit fork detection on win32.
    o windows mutex or critical_section; not pthreads.
    - make egd code compile on windows.
  o Make make make.
  o Match glibc coding style more closely
  . Unit tests
    o ChaCha20 test vectors from libottery
    o Blake2[bs] test vectors from blake2 source
    - Fresh blake2 test vectors with personalization.
    o Test the streaming rng in 'ottery_bytes'.
    - Test as many entropy sources as possible.
    - "Shallow" tests from libottery.
    o Actual test driver.
  . Better API
    - Include a 'status' thing.
  . Benchmark

  . Flexible API

  - Dedication notice and header on all files.

  - Smarter fork handling.

  - Fix all XXXX comments

  - Document the code
  - Document the approach

  . Better allocation
    o use mmap like openbsd likes to use.
    o use mlock.

  - Support MAP_INHERIT_ZERO / MAP_NO_INHERIT.

  - Support atfork stuff, just in case.


  - Skip tests that aren't expected to work on big-endian systems when
    on big-endian systems.

  - Re-run uncrustify and emacs indent



Not for 1.0:

  - Split into more files

  - Better arch independence

  - Make more tests pass on big-endian systems

  - Spinlocks for fast-yield cases

  - Actually match glibc style.

  - Sometimes use blake2s?
