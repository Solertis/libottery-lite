For 1.0
  o Support more platforms in entropy gathering
  o Cleanup function
  o Namespace the public functions.
  . Unit tests
    o ChaCha20 test vectors from libottery
    o Blake2[bs] test vectors from blake2 source
    - Fresh blake2 test vectors with personalization.
    o Test the streaming rng in 'ottery_bytes'.
    - Test as many entropy sources as possible.
    - "Shallow" tests from libottery.
    o Actual test driver.

  o Make make make.

  . Better API
    - Include a 'status' thing.

  . Flexible API
    o Make it able to call itself arc4random

  o Add an addrandom function

  - Dedication notice and header on all files.

  - Smarter fork handling.

  . Support win32; build with mingw32
    - Omit fork detection on win32.
    - windows mutex or critical_section; not pthreads.

  . Benchmark

  - Fix all XXXX comments

  - Detect 32 vs 64
  - Document the code
  - Document the approach

  - Better allocation; use mmap like openbsd likes to use.

  - Support MAP_INHERIT_ZERO / MAP_NO_INHERIT.

  - Support atfork stuff, just in case.

  o Match glibc coding style more closely

  - Skip tests that aren't expected to work on big-endian systems when
    on big-endian systems.

Not for 1.1:

  - Split into more files

  - Better arch independence

  - Make more tests pass on big-endian systems

  - Spinlocks for fast-yield cases
