For 1.0
  o Support more platforms in entropy gathering
  o Cleanup function
  o Namespace the public functions.
  o Add an addrandom function
  o Make it able to call itself arc4random
  o Win32
    o Omit fork detection on win32.
    o windows mutex or critical_section; not pthreads.
    o make egd code compile on windows.
  o Make make make.
  o Match glibc coding style more closely
  o Better allocation
    o use mmap like openbsd likes to use.
    o use mlock.

  o Support MAP_INHERIT_ZERO / MAP_NO_INHERIT.
    o Use MAP_INHERIT_ZERO
    o use minherit({VM_,INHERIT_NONE}) otherwise

  o Early unit tests
    o ChaCha20 test vectors from libottery
    o Blake2[bs] test vectors from blake2 source
    o Test the streaming rng in 'ottery_bytes'.
    o Actual test driver.
    o Fresh blake2 test vectors with personalization.

  o Better API
    o Include a 'status' thing.

  . Benchmark
    - Include const-time checking

  o Fallback RNG for windows.

  o Smarter fork handling.
    o Support atfork stuff, just in case.
    o Fix redundant atfork calls
    o Avoid getpid() checks when INHERIT_ZERO is in use.

  . Flexible API

  - Later unit tests
    . Test as many entropy sources as possible.
      o easy tests
      o Generic urandom reader.
      - egd tests
      - failing-case tests, where possible.
    o Test entropy dispatcher
    - "Shallow" tests from libottery.
    o Tests for fork handling!
    - Make the tests pass when built with state.

  - Turn more defines into functions.

  - Fix all XXXX comments

  - Document the code
  - Document the approach

  - Dedication notice and header on all files.

  - actually run the unit tests on windows
  - actually run the unit tests on *bsd

  - Skip tests that aren't expected to work on big-endian systems when
    on big-endian systems.

  - Re-run uncrustify and emacs indent


Probably not for 1.0:

  - Spinlocks for fast-yield cases?

Not for 1.0

  - Split into more files

  - Better arch independence in code

  - Make more tests pass on big-endian systems

  - Actually match glibc style.

  - Sometimes use blake2s?

  - Avoid getpid() checks when INHERIT_NONE and atfork are in use??
